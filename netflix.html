              <h2>
                Question 2A
              </h2>
              <h5>Our response to the CEO</h5>
              <p>
                The CEO’s idea is perfectly aligned with the way in which technology is heading. We do have a few concerns regarding the detail and asked 
                the following questions: How would we be able to go about the effective implementation thereof? In order to gain more certainty, we would have to analyse 
                competitive data. Insights on the growth margins of competitors could show us how effective the implementation of a product like this would be.
We are consequently in favour of the CEO’s idea; however, we propose that the content part of it takes a different direction. Our concerns regarding the content are as follows: 
Firstly, are people very interested about seeing each other’s homes? Secondly, if the experience rating is based on one’s current location and lifestyle vs that of the house that 
they are visiting - this could cause some tensions around classism and other prejudices. 
Africans love traveling and seeing the world. Unfortunately, many don’t have the opportunity to do so because of financial constraints. A better content package would be to offer 
users a cross-cultural experience where they can tour (see) the countries, cities, and towns that some of their favourite shows are set in; watching a show would give them access
 to a virtual experience that brings them into those destinations. 
Each destination will receive an experience rating from the user, and certain shows can be recommended based on that rating and having the opportunity to tour the 
country/city/town that the show is set in. The user would have to complete at least 25% of each season’s episodes to unlock their virtual tour of the different destinations showcased by different productions. This will also encourage people to not only watch shows based on whether it’s their kind of show or not but will encourage them to explore shows outside of their ‘scope’. Essentially, users will also pick shows based on the real-life destinations that they’ve always dreamed of visiting. 
With Netflix also broadening its footprint across Africa, it would encourage a bigger focus on creating African originals - offering users from other continents the opportunity 
to virtually experience the African continent - giving stronger meaning to the #AfricaRising theme. </p>

                <h2>QUESTION 2F</h2>
                
                
                <p>The team has already factored in slack days in our sprint planning to cater for unexpected events. However, we do not know
                   when the developer will be back so it might become a problem if he takes longer to recover than we had planned for.

                  Our velocity is currently three backlog items per sprint so that could be affected, but our main goal is not completing 
                  backlogs as much as it is to complete our sprint goals as set by the product owner and the team.
                  
                  We first have to bring up the issue of the sick developer at our daily scrum and ask the team if they can still meet the 
                  Sprint goal without the developer. If not, we would have to consult with the product owner to change the scope for the
                   sprint because the team is working at a smaller capacity.
                  
                  We would then have to decrease the velocity of the sprint in order to meet the sprint goal.
                  
                  After all of this is determined by the product owner, we would need to invite the CEO and stakeholders to a meeting where
                   we will communicate the new MVP dates. We cannot meet with him before the Product owner has reordered the backlog items and
                    recalculated our velocity because we might make false assumptions about our new delivery dates.

          <h2>QUESTION 4A</h2>
            <p>
              We would explain to the CEO that we can complete some key features at a faster rate using Scrum. Using Scrum, we divide the project into smaller tasks that we 
              can develop, test and release in increments.

Putting the features in Sprints will guarantee that we’re releasing quality features without compromising on time.

Research shows that Scrum has saved companies both time and money and has increased productivity.

We understand the CEO’s concerns.

Both Agile and Waterfall methodologies are effective for software development and are both valid.

According to research “there is no right or wrong methodology. It is rather a preference made by the business, customer, project team and project manager to come up with the 
best methodology for the project or project phase. For software projects [such as the one we’re doing], agile methodologies have proven to be more often successful, especially 
when it comes to scope, project time, quality and resources”.

Waterfall seems like a good option for the CEO because he would have more clarity in terms of the framework, more detailed documentation for him to look at instead of attending 
meetings, and it will allow him to have a more hands-off approach to the project and won’t have to attend to constant meetings with the team as he might be pressed for time. 
However, using the waterfall methodology might compromise on customer involvement in the development and testing processes. This would be going against our approach as Netflix 
which is “customer-led product development”. 
Making changes would also prove to be difficult in case we encounter a roadblock. Last minute testing would also prove to be difficult as waterfall has an end date to the project
 and developing a whole new platform for our customers might need continuous research, development and testing.

Agile development, in this case would allow us adaptability throughout the project.

Using agile has improved our teamwork, accountability and time. We are now able to deliver more frequently with tested features that the CEO can approve and implement 
immediately.

We can develop in increments called Sprints which last just a few weeks and can use feedback from previous sprints to improve and plan on the next one.
Unlike with the waterfall approach, there is a testing phase that will allow more customer involvement through every phrase of the project.

It would also allow us to create a higher quality and user-friendly product.

       <h2>QUESTION 4B</h2>
         <p>
          To accelerate development, we would have to go back to our backlog and see what we can do without and what we can develop sooner without compromising on quality and
           time.

          We would have to take on some technical debt and leave some features for later in the process. Although this might contribute to a more complex system, in the end it
           will help us meet a shorter deadline. 
          
          We would need to track our technical debt and add it as a story point, so we deal with it later.
          
          We could for example, make building relationships with creators a lesser priority and move up software development in order to get the product out faster. We would
           incur technical debt here, but we can always improve this at a later stage on the platform and bring on better creators well after the platform has been created.

                  <p>Our almost daily stand-up meetings was always fun with a lot of learning and collaboration. Our team was made up of individuals with very different backgrounds
                     and our way of thinking was highlighted even more. We were forced to think out of the box to answer critical questions. Many times we were at loggerheads with 
                     certain questions but we dealt with our differences respectfully and we overcame our issues. This project had many similarities to real world problems, and this
                     what I really liked the most, it was never something farfetched. There is no “I” in team and the quicker we understand this the better our teams and projects will

                  <p>Some of the applications we tried to make use of required paid access. This was a bit of an issue because we were limited to what we could create and design. The free 
                    applications we used helped us in the end.</p>

                    and longevity of projects. There is no “I” in team and the quicker we understand this the better our teams and projects will run.</p>

                <h2>what you liked and why:</h2>
                <p>I really enjoyed seeing a cross functional team coming together. Each of us harbor skills that we utilize in our daily work life so seeing how everyone could use
                   the irrespective skill(s) for the benefit of the project on hand, was satisfying to witness.Learning from each other enabled me to grow in knowledge and having
                    to deal withgroup dynamics throughout the course of the project also had a positive impact on me. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>what you disliked and why:</h2>
                <p>The overwhelming amount of information at hand to complete this project. Working on a project such as this one already has added pressure in having to 
                  think holistically in answering all questions. The handbook presented to us was filled witha huge amount of information, which also made it tricky in having to
                   search andscrutinize certain information.</p>

                <h2>what you think you have learned in these exercises:</h2>
                <p>Different opinions are a result of different perspectives. I have had to learn that all of us harbor a different way in which we analyse data and creating 
                  content. This leads to us having our respective opinions on how to deal with certain exercises, whichhas thus taught me patience and the ability to listen and 
                  understand another persons’ viewpoint.</p>

              <li>
                <h2>what you liked and why:</h2>
                <p>More than anything, I enjoyed the chemistry our team was able to forge right from the beginning. The level of respect that we had for each other made working 
                  together an elevating experience. We had close-to-daily stand up meetings where we shared ideas and perspectives and collaborated on crafting our answers -  
                  always making sure that everyone’s input, in some way or another, was reflected in each task.We learned a lot about agile methodologies not only through all 
                  the text we were reading, and the answers we were answering – but through each other via the dynamic discussions and debates we’d have before beginning to craft
                  our answers. We understood each other’s’ strengths and that’s why I believe we were able to hand in such a high-quality project. Lastly, I also liked how
                   immediately applicable a lot of methodologies and strategies we learned about in this module were.

              <li>
                <h2>what you disliked and why:</h2>
                <p>At times, the wide scope of information felt overwhelming. I think this possibly contributed to me overthinking a lot of things. Fortunately, as a team – 
                  whenever someone felt like there was something that didn’t make sense, there was always someone else who had a better understanding and would be able to break 
                  it down. This helped ease a lot of the anxiety that comes with overthinking and led to us submitting something that wasclear, logical, on the mark and something
                   that we’re all proud of.</p>

              <li>
                <h2>what you think you have learned in these exercises:</h2>
                <p>A lot! For one, the project gave us the opportunity to explore and experiment with applications we would have otherwise never come across. Applications such as 
                  Figma and Mural were completely new to me.Other applications - such as Google Slides - were applications I knew about, but I didn’t necessarily think of them as 
                  high-value collaboration tools – which is how I see them now.  These exercises also taught me about other ways that I could further driveefficiency and 
                  collaboration in my current work.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>what you think you could apply in your current job:</h2>
                <p>There are a number of bits and pieces that I plan to apply to my current work from the many methodologies that we dealt with in this module. I think the 7 lean
                   development principles actually sum these up quite nicely
                  for me and they are what I will be carrying forward. Those are the values and principles that I think we should be striving for, particularly as a digital 
                  platform that must always delivery quality content quickly all throughout the day.</p>

                <h2>what you liked and why:</h2>
                <p>The exercise took me out of my comfort zone, and it was inordinate that I could engage in a project of this nature that is totally in a new genre to what I am
                   accustom to.  This was my first-time making use of the Fibonacci sequence, Mural, Jira, Google slides, story mapping, sprints, hubspot.com, exploring how to

                  business together and everyone bringing their respective strengths to the group to make this assignment a success. This highlighted my personal strengths and 
                  weaknesses and lead me to doing my personal SWOT analysis to date.</p>

                <h2>what you liked and why:</h2>
                <p>Coming into this course I wasn’t sure what to expect. I was nervous about whether it the course work would be – best- and worst-case scenario – somethingI 
                  already knew or something too difficult for me to understand. Fortunately, it was none of these things.The classes and the project introduced me to ways of 
                  working I didn’t know currently existed. The class exercises with Cara were incredibly interesting and challenged me to work using project management methods 
                  and software that made it easy to understand.The project also pushed me to research more and introduced to software such asJira, Mural and Figma which were 
                  really interesting to use and showed me easier ways for teams to work.I also loved working with people from different departments within Media24. Their input 
                  and outlook challenged the way I think about work and pushed me to want to work harder and know more. We learned and worked very well together. </p>

                <p>I understand that we didn’t have much time in the classroom but I did feel as if some of my questions were left very unanswered by the notes and in the
                   classroom. Luckily I learned through  research, reading other sources and watching videos but as I have not engaged with the content before, it would have 
                   been much appreciated to have certain concepts properly explained through examples relevant to me.</p>

                  keep track of what my team is doing and how much work is actually getting done. I’ve lead a team in a previous position and I couldn’t help but think if I had 
                  known these methods before, how much more productive we could’ve been.I am excited about using these in the future.</p>

                   gets done by whom, when and how. It will also help me track my teams progress so much better and assist with data on well each person is performing and show 
                   potential bottlenecks in our progress. This will improve how we all work together and accountability</p>
